# Grocery List App
This is a simple and clean grocery list app I built to manage daily items easily. Instead of using complex libraries, I used pure web technologies to keep the code fast and easy to understand for everyone.

### Key Features
**Clean Design:** A professional and colorful layout that works well on all screen sizes.
**Easy Item Management:** I added a simple way to add and remove items from the list instantly.
**Remove Button:** Each item has a delete icon, making it very intuitive to manage your list.
**Good Icons:** I used Font Awesome icons to make the UI look more polished and modern.
**Responsive:** The app is fully responsive, so it looks great on both mobile and desktop.

### Why I Built This
The goal was to create a practical tool that is both functional and well-designed. I kept the project organized by using separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the code clean and easy to maintain.

### Tech Stack
**HTML5:** For the basic structure of the app.
**CSS3:** For the styling, colors, and responsive layout.
**Vanilla JavaScript:** For the add and remove logic without using extra libraries.
**Bootstrap 5:** For a quick and professional-looking grid.

### How to Use
Just download or clone the folder and open the index.html file in your browser. No extra setup is needed!
