# grocery-list-app
Created a clean and responsive grocery list app to manage daily items efficiently. I used Bootstrap 5 for the UI and custom CSS for a modern feel, while handling the add and remove functionality with Vanilla JavaScript to keep the logic lightweight. The project is structured into separate files to make it more organized and easier to maintain.
